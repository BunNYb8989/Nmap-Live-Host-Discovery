# Nmap-Live-Host-Discovery
Task 1 (Introduction)
We present the different approaches that Nmap uses to discover live hosts. In particular, we cover:

ARP scan: This scan uses ARP requests to discover live hosts
ICMP scan: This scan uses ICMP requests to identify live hosts
TCP/UDP ping scan: This scan sends packets to TCP ports and UDP ports to determine live hosts.
We also introduce two scanners, arp-scan and masscan, and explain how they overlap with part of Nmap’s host discovery.

Task 2
Subnetworks

A network segment is a group of computers connected using a shared medium. For instance, the medium can be the Ethernet switch or WiFi access point.
                                         In an IP network, a subnetwork is usually the equivalent of one or more network segments connected together and configured to use the same router.
- The network segment refers to a physical connection, 
- while a subnetwork refers to a logical connection.

 we have four network segments or subnetworks. Generally speaking, your system would be connected to one of these network segments/subnetworks.
 A subnetwork, or simply a subnet, has its own IP address range and is connected to a more extensive network via a router. There might be a firewall enforcing security policies depending on each network.
