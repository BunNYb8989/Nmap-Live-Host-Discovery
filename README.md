# Nmap-Live-Host-Discovery
Task 1 (Introduction)
We present the different approaches that Nmap uses to discover live hosts. In particular, we cover:

ARP scan: This scan uses ARP requests to discover live hosts
ICMP scan: This scan uses ICMP requests to identify live hosts
TCP/UDP ping scan: This scan sends packets to TCP ports and UDP ports to determine live hosts.
We also introduce two scanners, arp-scan and masscan, and explain how they overlap with part of Nmap’s host discovery.

Task 2
Subnetworks

A network segment is a group of computers connected using a shared medium. For instance, the medium can be the Ethernet switch or WiFi access point.
                                         In an IP network, a subnetwork is usually the equivalent of one or more network segments connected together and configured to use the same router.
- The network segment refers to a physical connection, 
- while a subnetwork refers to a logical connection.

 we have four network segments or subnetworks. Generally speaking, your system would be connected to one of these network segments/subnetworks.
 A subnetwork, or simply a subnet, has its own IP address range and is connected to a more extensive network via a router. There might be a firewall enforcing security policies depending on each network.

Suppose you are connected to a subnet different from the subnet of the target system(s). In that case, all packets generated by your scanner will be routed via the default gateway (router) to reach the systems on another subnet; however, the ARP queries won’t be routed and hence cannot cross the subnet router. ARP is a link-layer protocol, and ARP packets are bound to their subnet.

- This means that while your scanner can send packets to the target systems on a different subnet, it won't be able to perform ARP queries to resolve the MAC addresses of those systems. Instead, 
- the router will handle the ARP resolution for the target subnet and forward the packets accordingly.
